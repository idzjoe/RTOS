# RTOS
This repository contains some very small pieces of code that was used in the "RTOS" course at KULeuven Faculty of Engineering Technology

## 1_

## 2_

## 3_threading
This folder contains code for the session about threading.

### philosophers
In this folder there are two source files: main.c and main2.c. The former gets compiled into 'philosophers', the latter in 'philosophers2'.
The first one should encounter a deadlock relatively fast. The second one contains the original Dijkstra solution (of just switching the order
of the spoons for a single philosopher).
